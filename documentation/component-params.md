# Component Params

Component params helps us create various ADMIN and other display properties.

As of now we have the 

```python
params = {
            "admin":{
                    "list_display":["id", "title", "slug",]
            }
}
```

**The goal is to have every param in this the same as the models, 
just able to be edited dynamically from the administration panel, without the need to push code.
Will see how this works.**

(As more things change we will update this file.)
