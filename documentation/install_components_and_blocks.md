# Install Components and Blocks

The dream of this application in django is to be simple.

The foundation of this goal is to allow for quickly adding applications, pages, etc to django --- the goal is to make a system as powerful as wordpress and as easily useable, django is not widely used because of a few things 

- 1 - it's a bit difficult to get started - there is not true entry point to use django unless you know how to code
- 2 - simplificty is key

  # How should installing your created application work? 
  
  This is one thing that is going to have to be well thought out
  but my goal is to reduce the need to run a command line to get the result
  being said that - it might be a bit difficult if the system is imperial ---
  so for now that is a dream but is something i want to incorporate into the system
  
  to begin i want a django mangent to work like this
  
  `python manage.py swishinstall applications`
  
  Someting on the line of that - it would go through all the installed applications and search for the swish configuration to install
