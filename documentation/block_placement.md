# Block Component Position

A block component is secondary to the view. 

A page can have multiple blocks, but can have only one component.

To render a block position you will include the following code

`{{ blocks 'position'}}`

Doing this will load all the blocks that are in that position for that particular page. 

The blocks output will follow a certain various stucture of HTML which  we will define later here...
